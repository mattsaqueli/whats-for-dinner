Significant other1: What should we eat?
Significant other2: Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's check out "What's for Dinner?".
Significant other1: Great idea :)

I built an application to solve the difficult decision of 'what to eat'! 
As a developer, I completely understand using all of your brain power for creative purposes, work, etc.
Sometimes thinking of a solution of a small problem such as 'what to eat' can be daunting.
Don't worry, I got you covered with a application that generates random meal options from sides, to main dishes, desserts, and even entire meals!
